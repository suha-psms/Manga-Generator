# Manga-Generator
A simple web application that uses OpenAI's API. Users give a title and a one-sentence theme for a manga, such as "Galactic Warriors: In a universe where stars are alive." The app provides a brief blurb or tagline for this manga. DALL-E then generates a potential cover image for the manga.
